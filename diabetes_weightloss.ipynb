      "\n",
      "Based on the provided data, here is a detailed analysis and recommendations for managing John Doe's diabetes:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Blood Sugar Levels:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* John's average blood sugar level is 129.5 mg/dL, which is slightly above the normal range.\n",
      "* His blood sugar levels are highest in the afternoon, around 12:00 pm, and lowest in the morning, around 08:00 am.\n",
      "* There is a noticeable spike in blood sugar levels after meals, particularly after breakfast and lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dietary Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* John's diet is high in sugar intake, with an average daily sugar consumption of 63.3 grams.\n",
      "* The majority of his sugar intake comes from breakfast foods, such as orange juice, Greek yogurt, banana, pancakes with syrup, and apple.\n",
      "* His lunch and dinner options are relatively low in sugar, but still contribute to his overall sugar intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Correlation between Blood Sugar Level and Meal Data:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* There is a strong correlation between John's blood sugar levels and his sugar intake. Specifically:\n",
      "\t+ Breakfasts with high sugar content (e.g., orange juice, banana, pancakes with syrup) result in higher blood sugar levels.\n",
      "\t+ Lunches and dinners with lower sugar content (e.g., Grilled Chicken Salad, Steak and Vegetables) result in lower blood sugar levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reduce Sugar Intake:** John should aim to reduce his daily sugar intake to less than 40 grams. This can be achieved by:\n",
      "\t* Replacing high-sugar breakfast foods with lower-sugar alternatives (e.g., oatmeal with nuts and seeds, scrambled eggs with vegetables).\n",
      "\t* Choosing fruits with lower sugar content (e.g., berries, citrus fruits).\n",
      "\t* Limiting or avoiding added sugars in foods and drinks.\n",
      "2. **Balance Macronutrients:** John should focus on balanced meals with appropriate portions of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats to regulate his blood sugar levels.\n",
      "3. **Kerala Cuisine:** Considering John's preferred cuisine is Kerala, I recommend incorporating traditional Kerala dishes that are low in sugar and rich in nutrients. Examples include:\n",
      "\t* Idli (steamed rice cakes) with sambar (lentil-based vegetable stew) for breakfast.\n",
      "\t* Thoran (stir-fried vegetables with coconut) with brown rice for lunch.\n",
      "\t* Meen curry (fish curry) with brown rice and vegetables for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Daily Meal Plan Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a sample daily meal plan for John, tailored to his Kerala cuisine preference and diabetes management needs:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Breakfast:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Idli with sambar (250 calories, 30g carbohydrates, 10g protein, 10g fat, 5g sugar)\n",
      "* Chutney made with coconut, coriander, and green chilies (100 calories, 20g carbohydrates, 2g protein, 2g fat, 2g sugar)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lunch:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Thoran made with mixed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, green beans) and coconut (150 calories, 20g carbohydrates, 5g protein, 10g fat, 5g sugar)\n",
      "* Brown rice (150 calories, 30g carbohydrates, 2g protein, 2g fat, 1g sugar)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dinner:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Meen curry made with fish, coconut milk, and spices (250 calories, 20g carbohydrates, 30g protein, 15g fat, 5g sugar)\n",
      "* Steamed vegetables (e.g., green beans, cauliflower) (50 calories, 10g carbohydrates, 2g protein, 2g fat, 2g sugar)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Snacks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Fresh fruits like berries or citrus fruits (100 calories, 20g carbohydrates, 2g protein, 2g fat, 10g sugar)\n",
      "* Roasted chana (chickpeas) seasoned with spices (100 calories, 20g carbohydrates, 5g protein, 2g fat, 2g sugar)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Beverages:**\n",
